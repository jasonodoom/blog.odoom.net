That means it is not real. Yet.</em></dl></br>\\n\\n\\n###Preface \\nThis post is less about APIs and concerns the moral implications of current technologies. This post does **not**  reflect any of my current beliefs. \\n\\nWith the advent of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in the mainstream there lies a plethora of moral and ethical concerns. And why not? If the genre of science fiction has taught us anything, when Man creates, he is doomed. There are many examples in Sci-Fi where the outcome is never perceived before creation. The scientist or main character usually creates to solve a problem that she or he thinks will benefit the greater good. However, what is usually disregarded is whether or not this creation will create new problems in the future. Ironically, this happens in the real world as well where we at times are focused on solving problems but fail to think beyond our solutions. Yet, one thing is certain, we should just learn how to solve problems without creating new ones.\\n\\n![MQ-9-Reaper-19-May-2017.jpg](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/MQ-9-Reaper-19-May-2017.jpg)\\n*A Reaper Drone.*\\n\\n The use of  an Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) beyond private sector and into personal or consumer use is alarming. Of course the Drones, as they are commonly referred to offered to consumers are incomparable to the advanced models used by military personnel. However, the sense that there is a \\\"dark history\\\" associated with these devices fails to reach buyers. Initially used for missions too \\\"dull, dirty or dangerous\\\" [^1] they've found greater use elsewhere. It's a bit strange to think how this machine, regardless of a difference in function and size when compared to consumer models have been used in sometimes clandestine operations where a person or people are murdered. After all, a UAV was used to kill the terrorist Osama bin Laden in 2011.[^2] So who can argue the cons when they've done so much good? And you can forget about civilian casualties. If they are able to kill terrorists then they are necessary. Not to mention if it were not for these machines we would not have exceptional aerial footage that have so greatly plagued the videos of our favorite YouTubers. Now all the masses have access to Drones, to do with whatever they choose. \\n \\n ![All-Totals-Dash29.jpg](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/All-Totals-Dash29.jpg)\\n *A Bar Chart displaying civilian casualties by Drone strike in Pakistan*\\n\\nHave we forgotten so quickly the collateral murders these machines have committed? The next time you operate or watch a film that was recorded using a Drone, think of the dead. \\n\\n###What is API?\\n\\nAPI is Application Programming Interface. It enables one to build applications using protocols and tools. Basically, APIs allow developers to interact or interface with an application by grabbing, adding and even sometimes modifying data. When you visit a dynamic website and search for a specific keyword you are interacting with an API via API calls. \\n\\n###Assassination via Curl\\n\\nConsider a world where a developer has created a remote API to interact with these unmanned vehicles and feed them instructions regarding what steps to take via a payload[^3]. Suddenly, programs will be created to assist in assasinations. Now envision such a concept married with the advent of A.I. and you've an autonomous device that can optionally take requests via API calls or do whatever it chooses to in compliance with the mission it was programmed to execute. Or not.\\n\\n![2001_a_space.gif](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/2001_a_space.gif)\\n![hal9000.gif](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/hal9000.gif)\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause A.I. has the potential to be unpredictable if we are not careful[^4].\\n\\nThe developers of the future will be the ones responsible for creating such tools  to fuel the war machine. Envision the many technologies that will become available. Most especially one which was my intention for writing this post: an API. To kill. \\n\\n\\nImagine an API call such as:\\n```bash\\ncurl -i -L --user api:eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJtZXNzYWdlIjoiSldUIFJ1bGVzIS\\\\ -X PUT -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\ --data '{\\\"instruction\\\": \\\"autonomous mode set on\\\"}' \\\\ target://eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuYXV0aDAuY29tLyIsImF1ZCI6Imh0d.gov/HBzOi8vYXBpLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tL2NhbGFuZGFyL3YxLyIsInN1YiI6InVzcl8xMjMiLCJpYXQiOjE0NTg3ODU3OTYsImV4cCI6MTQ1ODg3MjE5Nn0.CA7eaHjIHz5NxeIJoFK9krqaeZrPLwmMmgI_XiQiIkQ\\n```\\n\\nI can only expect that in this scenario HTTPS would not be used, allowing the management or control over these vehicles to be handled over a newly created protocol. In the example above, I've just called it the **target://** protocol. Use your imagination. \\n\\n \\n###But what does this mean for the future? \\n\\nThat's the concern. The future of war will only become more sophisticated as time progresses. we are approaching these possiblities. [^5] Morality is important because without it there would not be the universally accepted concepts of good and bad to judge our actions against. I can only highly recommend[ this post ](https://medium.com/@andychadha2/have-a-code-of-ethics-before-you-code-691ba7aa0582\\n) which details this principle further in relation to roles developers play in \\\"building the future.\\\" \\n\\nAs developers, we must choose between good and evil. The work we do can either build nations or destroy them. It's easier said than done like most things. The number of zeroes on a check is tempting and is what drives most people. However, if you can live with the guilt your immoral decisions as a developer creates then continue.  \\n\\n![alexanddroogs.gif](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/alexanddroogs.gif)\\n*Alex and his droogs living carelessly.*\\n\\n###How to tell if something is immoral\\n\\nApply the categorical imperative:[^6]\\n\\n* Ask, \\\"Should this be universal law?\\\"\\n* Ask, \\\"Is this good for me?\\\"\\n* Ask, \\\"Is this good for others?\\\"\\n* Ask, \\\"Is this good for the world?\\\"\\n\\nIf the answer is \\\"no\\\", walk away.\\n\\n\\n\\n[^1]:https://web.archive.org/web/20090724015052/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj91/spr91/4spr91.htm\\n[^2]:https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/drone-staked-out-bin-ladens-neighborhood-180958482/\\n[^3]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing)\\n[^4]:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/04/06/elon-musks-nightmarish-warning-ai-could-become-an-immortal-dictator-from-which-we-would-never-escape/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f6982b390253\\n[^5]: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/drone-crashes/how-drones-work/?noredirect=on\\n[^6]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative\\n\\n\"},{\"children\":[],\"direction\":null,\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":null,\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"root\",\"version\":1}}","html":"<dl><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><em>&nbsp;This is a fictitious post.

This post does not reflect any of my current beliefs.\n\n\nWith the advent of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in the mainstream there lies a plethora of moral and ethical concerns. And why not? If the genre of science fiction has taught us anything, when Man creates, he is doomed. There are many examples in Sci-Fi where the outcome is never perceived before creation. The scientist or main character usually creates to solve a problem that she or he thinks will benefit the greater good. However, what is usually disregarded is whether or not this creation will create new problems in the future. Ironically, this happens in the real world as well where we at times are focused on solving problems but fail to think beyond our solutions. Yet, one thing is certain, we should just learn how to solve problems without creating new ones.\n\n\n\n\nA Reaper Drone.\n\n\nThe use of an Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) beyond private sector and into personal or consumer use is alarming.

The string \"poop\" is being compared with each element in the array and returned until we've reached the end of the array.\n\n1 => \"poop\", 2 => \"poop\", 3 => \"poop\", etc.\n\nNow that we've covered the each and map iterators there are two important methods to cover, they are enumerables.\n\nI like to think of these iterators as \"picky iterators\"[1] as they return based on whichever condition is written in the block.\n\n\n\nselect\n\n\nThe select enumerable, selects (see I told you these methods were appropriately named) elements from an array based on a condition and returns them.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].select do |num|\n    num.even?\nend\n\n\n\nThe code above will literally select only even numbers in the array.\n\n\nTherefore, the return value will be:\n\n\n=> [2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\n\n \n\nNo surprises right?\n\n\n \n\nHere's another:\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].select do |num|\n    7\nend\n\n\n\nThe return value will be:\n\n\n=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n\n\nThe block in this example was ignored because there was no condition.\n\n\n\nfind\n\n\nOur last enumerable finds or returns only the first element per our condition.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].find do |num|\n    num.even?\nend \n\n\n\nThe return value will only be the first element of the array that is even.\n\n\nTherefore, its return value will be:\n\n\n => 2 \n\n\n\nAnd that's it!\n\n\nI like to think of find as a dog who plays fetch.\n\n\n\n\nDog playing fetch GIF\n\n\n \n\nThese are some of Ruby's iterators and enumerables, it is important to know when one must be used in order to return the expected output. There are also many other methods that do more. If you're curious, just read the docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Technically select and find are not iterators unlike each and map which are. They are enumerators and provide many methods to search based on conditions.\n    \n    https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Enumerable.html ↩︎\n    \n\n","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2018-10-08 13:58:03","updated_at":"2023-12-01 02:22:49","published_at":"2018-10-15 03:11:33","custom_excerpt":"I must admit, since I've began programming in Ruby, if you were to track stats on the iterator I use the most, embarrassingly it would be each.

I knew my time was limited so I did not want to pursue a gargantuan task. From experience, I came to the conclusion that a game would not be a good option. However, this is what I decided upon as at the time it seemed like a very basic idea. But I lacked sincerity. Eventually, I did create a \"game\", if one could even call it that.\n\n\n\nThere was no planning, no organization. Initially....\n\n\nI knew I wanted to put my skills to use. But how? Program a Bot in Ruby? Create a Ruby Gem (currently looking into this)? Since I would soon be utilizing ActiveRecord, I decided that it would make sense to spend additional time with it. In a non-linear series of events I found myself Friday afternoon noting the model class I would create, what I would like to think of as \"the philosophy.\" At times I find this overwhelming not because I think it's difficult but I tend to overthink the relationships.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Strange GIF\n\n\nEspecially in this instance where we've a Post Office, Delivery Person and Recipient. The language also didn't help. I will agree a post office is a post office (or is it postal office?). And a recipient could be a receiver but recipient is more formal. Yet, what really bothered me was what to call the delivery person. Delivery man? No, sexist. Delivery woman? No, sexist. Deliverer? Informal and with an arguably religious connotation. With some help, it was agreed that delivery person was the better choice.\n\n\nNow that this issue had been resolved the next problem was the relationships.[2]\n\n\nThis model would be a has many relationship. That was obvious. This would allow me to build a one-to-many connection with Delivery Person being our join table. So a post office then has many delivery people, it also has many recipients through a delivery person (join). Great, got it. A delivery person would then belong to a post office and a delivery person would also belong to a recipient.\n\n\nAnd this is when I had to prevent myself from overthinking or questioning this relationship. Because this is not politics. The notion that in this model class a delivery person belongs to a post office and a recipient philosophically is not the same as saying a dog belongs to an owner. These relationships aren't meant for such scrutiny. Yet, at times I find these ideas difficult to avoid. But I pushed forward.\n\n\nThere is also a similar relationship for the Recipient class where a recipient belongs to a delivery person (that's fair just not in the philosophical/moral sense). The recipient also belongs to a post office as the post office exists to deliver mail in which it would no longer if there were no recipients to deliver to. Fair. [3]\n\n\nAt long last, we had our three classes:\n\n\npostoffice.rb\n\n\nclass PostOffice < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :delivery_people\n  has_many :recipients, through: :delivery_people\nend \n\n\n\ndeliveryperson.rb\n\n\nclass DeliveryPerson < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :post_office\n  belongs_to :recipient\nend   \n\n\n\nrecipient.rb\n\n\nclass Recipient < ActiveRecord::Base\n belongs_to :delivery_person\n belongs_to :post_office\nend\n\n\n\nAnd that's essentially all we need to do. Because ActiveRecord basically takes care of the basics so you don't have to! At that point you can begin writing code.\n\n\nIn the below example we've a Driver class which would be included with other models such as Passenger and Ride (join). This would be the \"old way\":\n\n\n\n\nclass Driver\n \n @@all = Array.new\n\n attr_accessor :name, :distance<\n\n  def initialize(name)\n    @name = name\n\n   @@all << self\n  end\n\n  def passenger_names # Returns an array of all Passengers' names a driver has driven.\n     array_of_passengers = Array.new\n    Passenger.all.each do |passenger|\n        array_of_passengers << passenger.name\n    end\n    return array_of_passengers.uniq!\n  end\n\n  def self.all\n    @@all\n  end\n  \n\n  def self.mileage_cap(distance) # Takes an argument of a distance (float) and returns an array of all Drivers who have driven over the mileage\n    overLimitDrivers = Array.new\n    Ride.all.each do |ride|\n      if ride.distance > distance.to_f\n        binding.pry\n        overLimitDrivers << ride.driver.name\n      end\n    end\n    overLimitDrivers\n  end\n\nend\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above there are two methods that have not been struck through. This is optional as you would still need to write methods to create, read, update or delete information. ActiveRecord is not magic. Though I would say you now have additional tools to make them shorter and efficient.\n\n\n\nGrammar is important, but we set the rules\n\n\nAn issue I had when creating a migration via rake was grammar. And although I could have overwrote this particular naming convention[4] I descended into the rabbit hole of Ruby's inflections[5]. These rules are dogma and will never change,[6] regardless of your opinion on why Ruby's plural version of a word doesn't make sense.\n\n\nHowever, I would admit that in this instance, I was at fault. I believed the plural of delivery person was delivery persons. However, it's actually delivery people. Duh.\n\n\nConfused child GIF\n\n\nI had assumed the inflector's default would be delivery persons since I've come acoss some inflections I did not agree with. But hey, at least Rails core knows to not inflect rice.[7]\n\n\n\nA one person Hackathon\n\n\nOnce the issues were resolved I began writing the code for the ActiveRecord-PostOffice project[8] which is functional but needs refactoring. It's not ambitious and I attempted to keep it simple as much as possible. I only had one weekend.\n\n\nThe basis of the game is that you (the player) are a delivery person and must deliver mail to your recipients. It was good fun and has left me with knowledge, questions and ideas to improve my Ruby experience. Hopefully, I can perfect it or create something better. Only time will tell...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html ↩︎\n    \n\n 2.

However, everyday I reconsider this for one particular reason: this film had an impact on me. More than *Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory* (in a good way).

Riddled with symbolism, dark humor and brilliant ideas on life's meaning and death it is almost difficult to leave the film without feeling anything.

It's apparent that he doesn't like his job or his life. He is not happy but bored of the constant routine. He lives life passively like a zombie until the day he meets his daughter's friend Angela. This is the first portion of  the film that confounded me. Because it was Angela that forced or rather encouraged Lester to reinvent himself to such an extent that in mantra throughout the film I asked, \\\"What happened to him?\\\" Because, in no attempt to endorse or justify gender roles, Lester's wife Carolyn was the obvious superior or alpha of the family. As some would say, she was \\\"der mann.\\\"  Lester would accept verbal abuse and all sorts of harassment from his wife. However, when Man reinvents himself he is reborn. And this not only included physical transformation but  mental as well.\\n\\n\\nTo appear more attractive to his daughter's friend Lester begins to workout. He also quits his job (well he's technically fired, kind of) by immorally extorting his boss and secures a year's salary. He then gets a job at a fast food restaurant that he seems pleased to work at. His attitude and confidence also quickly change. When he catches his wife cheating on him at his job's drive-through, he handles himself maturely. Which is ironic as earlier in his rebirth I quipped how his behavior equated to that of a teenager's. Yet, during the last months of his life Lester truly finds happyness. \\n\\n### Lessons I learned from *American Beauty*\\n\\n* Take Risks\\n\\nLester took a risk by quitting his job. A father of one but with a family to care for this was a reckless decision. Yet, he didn't let the situation stop him. \\n\\n* Live your best authentic life / Be your best authentic self (live your truth)\\n\\nAt the end of the film, Lester is murdered by his daughter's boyfriend's father - retired US Marine Corps Coloniel Frank Fitts after Fitts reveals to Lester that he is a homosexual.[^3] It is this event that causes Frank to murder Lester in the end of the film. Because no one must know his secret.\\n\\n* Have morals to live by\\n\\nAlthough this is a good lesson to learn, the decision Lester made fails to justify his intentions. In the end of the film he has his chance with Angela. However, after learning that she is a virgin and had lied about her promiscuity he no longer seeks sexual intercourse with her. Lester doesn't get a pardon because he changes his mind about having sex with an underage girl. This doesn't make him good or relents his past behavior. However, this lesson did not escape me.  \\n\\n* Accept the things you cannot change\\n\\nA Stoic principle. Lester accepted that his wife had cheated on him and that he could do nothing. Nevertheless, he did not let this situation affect him.\\n\\n* Don't settle. EVER.\\n\\nIf you want something, go get it. Don't settle for less or with whatever is available. Lester was a basic and stereotypical suburban father who lived a very boring and repetitive life. Eventually, he broke out of this cycle and found some purpose. It's difficult to communicate this with synopsis in mind. However, another example would be Lester's unhappiness with his wife, her materialism and obsession with nonsensical things. He took it upon himself to curb her behavior.\\n\\n###What does American Beauty say about normality?\\n\\nI don't know. That conformity is boring? I think the issue with suburban culture is that it is very bland. It's arguably a slice of the \\\"American Dream.\\\" If you've made it to suburbia then surely you've made it in America. Right? Yet, normality is dull and even those in suburbia haven't found joy because of the environment or pseudo success. It fails to provide even a sense of escapism from the stresses of the world and incomparably others living elsewhere, (in urban or rural environments) may be just as happy without the unnecessary scale of life that accompanies such a setting.   \\n\\n\\n###What does American Beauty say about self-reinvention?\\n\\nPossibly one of my favorite aspects of the film. Lester is motivated immorally, but yet he is motivated and begins to live his best life. He changes his situation, truly taking his life into his own hands. In terms of reinvention, I would say anyone and everyone is capable of change. One just needs to find a reason to change. \\n\\nAt  the end of the film we are left with what was initially not to be the ending. Lester was indeed to have sex with Angela and they would then run away together. But this did not happen and we were given the current ending where he is murdered. An ending which I am satisfied with. Because in a way, Lester's refusal to have sex with Angela is a small moment of redemption. A sort of confession where he asks for forgiveness and then he has truly been reborn. I like this ending. \\n\\n\\n[^1]:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/\\n[^2]:This is one of my favorite scenes from the film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB0th8vNLxo\\n[^3]:The circumstances relating to this event were comical.

If you don't like spoilers or you've not seen the film, go watch it and return later. You've been warned.\n\n\nLast Friday, I had the privilege of watching American Beauty. It was such an outstanding film I asked myself, \"Why have I waited so long to see this?\" Yet, it's understandable. The synopsis is unappealing, A sexually frustrated suburban father has a mid-life crisis after becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend.[1] Umm.... okay, no thanks. Reading the synopsis robs the film of any justice. I can only highly recommend everyone watch it.\n\n\nPrior to viewing it, my favorite film was Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. However, everyday I reconsider this for one particular reason: this film had an impact on me. More than Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (in a good way). And even at the ending when the credits began to roll I was left alone with my thoughts on what the director wanted to convey through this work. Riddled with symbolism, dark humor and brilliant ideas on life's meaning and death it is almost difficult to leave the film without feeling anything. I envy those who saw it in cinema the day of release. And if there was some profound conclusion in which I had left with, it is to find the beauty in everything.[2]\n\n\nAmerican Beauty is innapropriate, I will admit. Nevertheless, it has a harsh MPAA rating of restricted (Rated R) which means you've to be 17 or older to see it alone. It is not sexually explicit but the subject matter and discussions make it unsuitable for younger viewers? It stars Kevin Spacey, (before the world found out what a monster he is) as Lester Burnham who becomes the catalyst for everything that unfolds. In no way is this post an attempt to critique the work. That takes time. Neither will I discuss in depth, Lester's brazen and uncanny attraction to an underage girl. Yet, there are some lessons I learned while watching the film that I feel the need to share. Certainly, these aren't all of them and depending on the viewer one might believe differently.\n\n\nLester Burnham, the main character of American Beauty works in advertising. It's apparent that he doesn't like his job or his life. He is not happy but bored of the constant routine. He lives life passively like a zombie until the day he meets his daughter's friend Angela. This is the first portion of the film that confounded me. Because it was Angela that forced or rather encouraged Lester to reinvent himself to such an extent that in mantra throughout the film I asked, \"What happened to him?\" Because, in no attempt to endorse or justify gender roles, Lester's wife Carolyn was the obvious superior or alpha of the family. As some would say, she was \"der mann.\" Lester would accept verbal abuse and all sorts of harassment from his wife. However, when Man reinvents himself he is reborn. And this not only included physical transformation but mental as well.\n\n\nTo appear more attractive to his daughter's friend Lester begins to workout. He also quits his job (well he's technically fired, kind of) by immorally extorting his boss and secures a year's salary. He then gets a job at a fast food restaurant that he seems pleased to work at. His attitude and confidence also quickly change. When he catches his wife cheating on him at his job's drive-through, he handles himself maturely. Which is ironic as earlier in his rebirth I quipped how his behavior equated to that of a teenager's. Yet, during the last months of his life Lester truly finds happyness.\n\n\n\nLessons I learned from American Beauty\n\n\n * Take Risks\n\n\nLester took a risk by quitting his job. A father of one but with a family to care for this was a reckless decision. Yet, he didn't let the situation stop him.\n\n\n * Live your best authentic life / Be your best authentic self (live your truth)\n\n\nAt the end of the film, Lester is murdered by his daughter's boyfriend's father - retired US Marine Corps Coloniel Frank Fitts after Fitts reveals to Lester that he is a homosexual.[3] It is this event that causes Frank to murder Lester in the end of the film. Because no one must know his secret.\n\n\n * Have morals to live by\n\n\nAlthough this is a good lesson to learn, the decision Lester made fails to justify his intentions. In the end of the film he has his chance with Angela. However, after learning that she is a virgin and had lied about her promiscuity he no longer seeks sexual intercourse with her. Lester doesn't get a pardon because he changes his mind about having sex with an underage girl. This doesn't make him good or relents his past behavior. However, this lesson did not escape me.\n\n\n * Accept the things you cannot change\n\n\nA Stoic principle. Lester accepted that his wife had cheated on him and that he could do nothing. Nevertheless, he did not let this situation affect him.\n\n\n * Don't settle. EVER.\n\n\nIf you want something, go get it. Don't settle for less or with whatever is available. Lester was a basic and stereotypical suburban father who lived a very boring and repetitive life. Eventually, he broke out of this cycle and found some purpose. It's difficult to communicate this with synopsis in mind. However, another example would be Lester's unhappiness with his wife, her materialism and obsession with nonsensical things. He took it upon himself to curb her behavior.\n\n\n\nWhat does American Beauty say about normality?\n\n\nI don't know. That conformity is boring? I think the issue with suburban culture is that it is very bland. It's arguably a slice of the \"American Dream.\" If you've made it to suburbia then surely you've made it in America. Right? Yet, normality is dull and even those in suburbia haven't found joy because of the environment or pseudo success. It fails to provide even a sense of escapism from the stresses of the world and incomparably others living elsewhere, (in urban or rural environments) may be just as happy without the unnecessary scale of life that accompanies such a setting.\n\n\n\nWhat does American Beauty say about self-reinvention?\n\n\nPossibly one of my favorite aspects of the film. Lester is motivated immorally, but yet he is motivated and begins to live his best life. He changes his situation, truly taking his life into his own hands. In terms of reinvention, I would say anyone and everyone is capable of change. One just needs to find a reason to change.\n\n\nAt the end of the film we are left with what was initially not to be the ending.

This is where you will go to make changes or additions to your routes via the <em>routes.rb</em> file. </p><p><strong>db</strong></p><p>The <em>db</em> directory contains the database schema, seeds, migrations and any other database-related files. </p><p><strong>lib </strong></p><p>The <em>lib</em> directory contains custom rake tasks as well as application specific libraries. This is where custom code that does not belong in <em>controllers</em>, <em>models</em>, or <em>helpers</em> live. </p><p><strong>log </strong></p><p>The <em>log</em> directory stores logs for your application.

However, there are some you should avoid in order to keep a clean codebase.</p><pre><code>rails generate controller NAME_OF_CONTROLLER ATTRIBUTES</code></pre><pre><code>rails generate scaffold  NAME ATTRIBUTES</code></pre><p>In most cases you may not want to run the two commands above.<a href=\"#footnote-two\"><sup>[2]</sup> </a>Unlike other options <em>rails g controller</em> will create a controller based on the model/controller name given along with all specified (optional) attributes. </p><p>It is extremely important your controller name be <em>plural</em>. For example, if you are building a website and require a Post controller then you should name your controller <em>Posts</em> and not Post!<a href=\"#footnote-three\"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><p>So let us do that:</p><p><code>rails g controller Posts</code> </p><p>Here is our output:</p><p><em>create  app/controllers/posts_controller.rb<br>invoke  erb<br>create    app/views/posts<br>invoke  test_unit<br>create    test/controllers/posts_controller_test.rb<br>invoke  helper<br>create    app/helpers/posts_helper.rb<br>invoke    test_unit<br>invoke  assets<br>invoke    coffee<br>create      app/assets/javascripts/posts.coffee<br>invoke    scss<br>create      app/assets/stylesheets/posts.scss</em></p><p>Rails generated the Posts controller which included the creation of the Posts views for sharing data with the controller. </p><p>./<em>app/controllers</em> and ./<em>app/views</em> are the only two directories in this generation that concern us at the moment. </p><h2 id=\"restful-functions\">RESTful functions</h2>\n<p>Most (good) web applications on the Internet make use of CRUD functionality. That is CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE which originated from database records. Data is created, read or accessed, updated by the user and can also be deleted. Think of this in terms of creating or editing a post on a social network. Except Twitter because you cannot edit (UPDATE) Tweets. So in this case I believe Twitter makes use of CRD functionality?</p><p>Rails' routing system combines verbs and URL patterns to route a user to a specific webpage depending on the request. When a user is routed to a page the process of CRUD takes place.<a href=\"#footnote-four\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This system is the foundation of REST which stands for Representational State Transfer that is an architectural style on how to develop web services. <a href=\"#footnote-five\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> </p><p>Rails recognizes requests and sends them to a controller's action. It also generates paths and URLs so we can avoid hardcoding them in our application which is not recommended. When we generated our controller above, we optionally could have specifed RESTful functions to be used.</p><p><code>rails g controller Posts index show new create edit update</code></p><p>Omitting those attributes provided us with an empty <em>routes.rb</em> file which is where we define these functions in our application. Specifically in <em>./config/routes.rb</em></p><p> This would have also generated the associated views for each RESTful function used in our Posts controller:</p><p><code>app/views/posts/</code><br>\n<code>├── create.html.erb</code><br>\n<code>├── edit.html.erb</code><br>\n<code>├── index.html.erb</code><br>\n<code>├── new.html.erb</code><br>\n<code>├── show.html.erb</code><br>\n<code>└── update.html.erb</code></p>\n<p>To manually configure our routes, we have to edit the <em>./config/routes.rb</em> file, listing the ones we need in our application:</p><p><code>get 'posts/:id/edit', to: 'posts#edit'</code></p><p>This maps the request for <em>posts/:id/edit</em> to a controller action in the posts controller.</p><p> For example, if you navigate or access a web page who's URL is  <em>http://example.org/posts/:1/edit</em> you would be directed to an edit page for that specific resource. With our current dynamic configuration we can avoid hardcoding or using a static path that will always map to the same request. </p><p>This is why the <em>id</em> portion of <em>posts/<strong>:id</strong>/edit </em>is important as it makes this possible (dynamic). </p><p>We optionally could define our routes using Resource routing:</p><p><code>resources :posts, only: [:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update]</code></p><p>or </p><p><code>resources :posts, only: %i[index show new create edit update]</code></p><p>as my linter recommends (to avoid using :symbols).</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<br>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>This will create 6 routes for our Posts model. </p><p>If we ran <code>rake routes</code> in our terminal we'd see the following:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-from-2019-02-08-11-30-44.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1399\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-from-2019-02-08-11-30-44.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-from-2019-02-08-11-30-44.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-from-2019-02-08-11-30-44.png 1399w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>As you can see the routes were generated as result of our ./c<em>onfig/routes.rb</em> file . </p><p><code>rake routes</code> returns the full list of rails routes.</p><p>On the left we have the path prefix or helper, then our HTTP methods and the URI pattern or path to access each action. We then are given on the right a view of the controller and action name for our model. Since we have created a Post model, our controller name will always be <em>posts</em> as mentioned previously. Each prefix is mapped to a controller action. So if we wanted to edit a post <em>/posts/:id/edit</em> we would define the action in our edit method in the posts controller as such:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-from-2019-02-08-11-45-34.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"387\" height=\"79\"></figure><p>This is saying for the requested post get us that page. <em>params</em> (parameters) originate from the user's browser when the page (or resource) is requested. </p><p>For example: <em>http://example.org/posts/2/edit</em> would request the edit page for post number 2.<a href=\"#footnote-six\"><sup>[6]</sup> </a></p><p>Our path prefixes are important because they save us time and are efficient. When we make use of action view form helpers such as <em>link_to,  form_tag</em>, <em>form_for, etc. </em>we will need to specify paths for different actions. If we simply use the path prefixes such as <em>new_post</em>, <em>edit_post</em>, etc.<a href=\"#footnote-seven\"><sup>[7]</sup> </a>instead of hardcoding the path then we can avoid having to manually change the routes as things change over time.

There is little work to be done if you are just replacing a single resource.

It does not care about what has changed. It replaces everything.</p><p><em>In a PUT request, the enclosed entity  is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced.

It provides you with almost everything you will need. One of the most important features given to you is the ability to create routes. Routes allow you to direct (or route) a specific page to a path or Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) which basically defines where a page can be found. [1] Due to the nature of Rails, once you create a route it will generate patters for those routes. Using the command rails routes displays all routes for the current application.\n\nLet's learn a bit about a Rails application!\n\n\nThe Structure\n\n\nAssuming you have Rails, run:\n\nrails new sample_app\n\nThis will create a new Rails application with a default directory structure contained in ./sample_app as specified in the above command.\n\nLet us take a look at what it provides:\n\n.\n└── sample_app\n    ├── app\n    │   ├── assets\n    │   │   ├── config\n    │   │   │   └── manifest.js\n    │   │   ├── images\n    │   │   ├── javascripts\n    │   │   │   ├── application.js\n    │   │   │   ├── cable.js\n    │   │   │   └── channels\n    │   │   └── stylesheets\n    │   │       └── application.css\n    │   ├── channels\n    │   │   └── application_cable\n    │   │       ├── channel.rb\n    │   │       └── connection.rb\n    │   ├── controllers\n    │   │   ├── application_controller.rb\n    │   │   └── concerns\n    │   ├── helpers\n    │   │   └── application_helper.rb\n    │   ├── jobs\n    │   │   └── application_job.rb\n    │   ├── mailers\n    │   │   └── application_mailer.rb\n    │   ├── models\n    │   │   ├── application_record.rb\n    │   │   └── concerns\n    │   └── views\n    │       └── layouts\n    │           ├── application.html.erb\n    │           ├── mailer.html.erb\n    │           └── mailer.text.erb\n    ├── bin\n    │   ├── bundle\n    │   ├── rails\n    │   ├── rake\n    │   ├── setup\n    │   ├── spring\n    │   ├── update\n    │   └── yarn\n    ├── config\n    │   ├── application.rb\n    │   ├── boot.rb\n    │   ├── cable.yml\n    │   ├── credentials.yml.enc\n    │   ├── database.yml\n    │   ├── environment.rb\n    │   ├── environments\n    │   │   ├── development.rb\n    │   │   ├── production.rb\n    │   │   └── test.rb\n    │   ├── initializers\n    │   │   ├── application_controller_renderer.rb\n    │   │   ├── assets.rb\n    │   │   ├── backtrace_silencers.rb\n    │   │   ├── content_security_policy.rb\n    │   │   ├── cookies_serializer.rb\n    │   │   ├── filter_parameter_logging.rb\n    │   │   ├── inflections.rb\n    │   │   ├── mime_types.rb\n    │   │   └── wrap_parameters.rb\n    │   ├── locales\n    │   │   └── en.yml\n    │   ├── master.key\n    │   ├── puma.rb\n    │   ├── routes.rb\n    │   ├── spring.rb\n    │   └── storage.yml\n    ├── config.ru\n    ├── db\n    │   └── seeds.rb\n    ├── Gemfile\n    ├── Gemfile.lock\n    ├── lib\n    │   ├── assets\n    │   └── tasks\n    ├── log\n    ├── package.json\n    ├── public\n    │   ├── 404.html\n    │   ├── 422.html\n    │   ├── 500.html\n    │   ├── apple-touch-icon.png\n    │   ├── apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\n    │   ├── favicon.ico\n    │   └── robots.txt\n    ├── Rakefile\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── storage\n    ├── test\n    │   ├── application_system_test_case.rb\n    │   ├── controllers\n    │   ├── fixtures\n    │   │   └── files\n    │   ├── helpers\n    │   ├── integration\n    │   ├── mailers\n    │   ├── models\n    │   ├── system\n    │   └── test_helper.rb\n    ├── tmp\n    │   ├── cache\n    │   │   └── assets\n    │   └── storage\n    └── vendor\n\n\n\n45 directories, 61 files\n\nLet us take a look at each directory and its purpose:\n\napp\n\nThe app directory contains models, views and controllers along with core functionality.\n\nbin\n\nThe bin directory contains built in Rails tasks. These are executable applications that you can use to interact with your app.\n\nconfig\n\nThe config directory contains environment, app, keybase and routes configurations. This is where you will go to make changes or additions to your routes via the routes.rb file.\n\ndb\n\nThe db directory contains the database schema, seeds, migrations and any other database-related files.\n\nlib\n\nThe lib directory contains custom rake tasks as well as application specific libraries. This is where custom code that does not belong in controllers, models, or helpers live.\n\nlog\n\nThe log directory stores logs for your application. This is great for debugging!\n\npublic\n\nThe public directory contains robots.txt, custom error pages, etc. for your application.\n\ntest\n\nThe test directory contains specs, test helpers, test directories, etc. for testing your application.\n\ntmp\n\nThe tmp directory contains temporary files. Similar to /tmp directory on Unix systems. Files stored here will not persist as expected!\n\nvendor\n\nThis directory stores third party code. Basically anything you did not write.\n\nGemfile\n\nThe Gemfile file contains all application gems.\n\nGemfile.lock\n\nThe Gemfile.lock file contains gem dependencies and should never be modified! It is a snapshot of all gem versions for your application.\n\nREADME.md\n\nThe README.md file contains documentation for your application.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\nNow that we have generated a skeleton for our Rails application, let us add some functionality.\n\nRails provides us with many options to generate configuration. However, there are some you should avoid in order to keep a clean codebase.\n\nrails generate controller NAME_OF_CONTROLLER ATTRIBUTES\n\nrails generate scaffold  NAME ATTRIBUTES\n\nIn most cases you may not want to run the two commands above.[2] Unlike other options rails g controller will create a controller based on the model/controller name given along with all specified (optional) attributes.\n\nIt is extremely important your controller name be plural. For example, if you are building a website and require a Post controller then you should name your controller Posts and not Post![3]\n\nSo let us do that:\n\nrails g controller Posts\n\nHere is our output:\n\ncreate app/controllers/posts_controller.rb\ninvoke erb\ncreate app/views/posts\ninvoke test_unit\ncreate test/controllers/posts_controller_test.rb\ninvoke helper\ncreate app/helpers/posts_helper.rb\ninvoke test_unit\ninvoke assets\ninvoke coffee\ncreate app/assets/javascripts/posts.coffee\ninvoke scss\ncreate app/assets/stylesheets/posts.scss\n\nRails generated the Posts controller which included the creation of the Posts views for sharing data with the controller.\n\n./app/controllers and ./app/views are the only two directories in this generation that concern us at the moment.\n\n\nRESTful functions\n\n\nMost (good) web applications on the Internet make use of CRUD functionality. That is CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE which originated from database records. Data is created, read or accessed, updated by the user and can also be deleted. Think of this in terms of creating or editing a post on a social network. Except Twitter because you cannot edit (UPDATE) Tweets. So in this case I believe Twitter makes use of CRD functionality?\n\nRails' routing system combines verbs and URL patterns to route a user to a specific webpage depending on the request. When a user is routed to a page the process of CRUD takes place.[4] This system is the foundation of REST which stands for Representational State Transfer that is an architectural style on how to develop web services. [5]\n\nRails recognizes requests and sends them to a controller's action. It also generates paths and URLs so we can avoid hardcoding them in our application which is not recommended. When we generated our controller above, we optionally could have specifed RESTful functions to be used.\n\nrails g controller Posts index show new create edit update\n\nOmitting those attributes provided us with an empty routes.rb file which is where we define these functions in our application. Specifically in ./config/routes.rb\n\nThis would have also generated the associated views for each RESTful function used in our Posts controller:\n\napp/views/posts/\n\n├── create.html.erb\n\n├── edit.html.erb\n\n├── index.html.erb\n\n├── new.html.erb\n\n├── show.html.erb\n\n└── update.html.erb\n\n\nTo manually configure our routes, we have to edit the ./config/routes.rb file, listing the ones we need in our application:\n\nget 'posts/:id/edit', to: 'posts#edit'\n\nThis maps the request for posts/:id/edit to a controller action in the posts controller.\n\nFor example, if you navigate or access a web page who's URL is http://example.org/posts/:1/edit you would be directed to an edit page for that specific resource. With our current dynamic configuration we can avoid hardcoding or using a static path that will always map to the same request.\n\nThis is why the id portion of posts/:id/edit is important as it makes this possible (dynamic).\n\nWe optionally could define our routes using Resource routing:\n\nresources :posts, only: [:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update]\n\nor\n\nresources :posts, only: %i[index show new create edit update]\n\nas my linter recommends (to avoid using :symbols).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will create 6 routes for our Posts model.\n\nIf we ran rake routes in our terminal we'd see the following:\n\nAs you can see the routes were generated as result of our ./config/routes.rb file .\n\nrake routes returns the full list of rails routes.\n\nOn the left we have the path prefix or helper, then our HTTP methods and the URI pattern or path to access each action. We then are given on the right a view of the controller and action name for our model. Since we have created a Post model, our controller name will always be posts as mentioned previously. Each prefix is mapped to a controller action. So if we wanted to edit a post /posts/:id/edit we would define the action in our edit method in the posts controller as such:\n\nThis is saying for the requested post get us that page. params (parameters) originate from the user's browser when the page (or resource) is requested.\n\nFor example: http://example.org/posts/2/edit would request the edit page for post number 2.[6]\n\nOur path prefixes are important because they save us time and are efficient. When we make use of action view form helpers such as link_to, form_tag, form_for, etc. we will need to specify paths for different actions. If we simply use the path prefixes such as new_post, edit_post, etc.[7] instead of hardcoding the path then we can avoid having to manually change the routes as things change over time. In this way we would only be making one modification and will not unintentionally break (HTTP 404) pages.\n\nBut what would happen if we simply did this?\n\nresources :posts\n\nWe then get all 7 RESTful routes! Or in the case of this post title, the 7 RESTFUL things!\n\nIf the web application we are developing is not a Twitter [8] clone and makes use of all routes then there is no need to specify the routes manually. We can just use resources keyword. There are also custom actions we could define in our ./config/routes.rb such as named routes.[9]\n\n\nWhat \"the things\" do\n\n\nTo make use of CRUD operations, we have to use specific HTTP methods for each action we want to utilize. These are the RESTful routes discussed above.\n\n\nGET\n\n\nThe GET request retrieves a resource only.\n\nIt is one of the most common requests you will see on the Internet.\n\nIn our example routes above, our first route:\n\nmakes use of GET to retrieve the index resource which is the hompeage of our application. For example, if we navigate to http://example.org/posts we will see the contents of the post controller's index action which of course is defined in the ./app/controllers/posts_controller.rb file and whose view (webpage) is located at ./app/views/posts/index.html.erb.\n\nThis defines an @posts instance variable (available to all methods) which gives us all records in our Post model.\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nUnlike GET, POST creates a new resource.\n\nIn the example of our rails routes, the user makes a GET request to new action in our posts controller .\n\nThis will retrieve the webpage to create a new post that when submitted will inititate the POST request, creating that post.\n\nOur ./app/controllers/posts_controller.rb file contains the code for both actions in their identical methods.\n\nThe new method (mapped to the new action as displayed in rails routes) renders a form to create a new post[10]as defined in our posts controller file.\n\nOur URI in this example is /posts/new (http://example.org/posts/new)\n\nA POST request to /posts (http://example.org/posts/) takes the created record from our new action above and passes it to the create action in our posts controller and stores it in the database.\n\n\nPUT\n\n\nA PUT request updates an existing resource.\n\nIn our rails routes output, the user makes a request to a post. This action like all others is defined in our posts controller file.\n\nIn order to update an existing resource, we must access it.\n\nOur routes define where the request is passed.\n\nOur URI in this example would then be /posts/:id/edit where id is the specific post we want to modify.\n\nFor example: http://example.org/posts/2/edit\n\nThe edit action finds the post we are looking for via the post id and renders the form to modify it.\n\nOur update method or action actually does the work by updating the post in our database which in this case will redirect us to the post page displaying the changes made to that post specifically.\n\n\nDELETE\n\n\nA DELETE request deletes or removes a resource.\n\nWe can view this request in our routes:\n\nThe example request URI is /posts/:id where we are accessing a specific post that we want to remove.\n\nThis is defined in the destroy action of our posts controller:\n\nHere we are calling the destroy method[11] on our Post model and finding the post by id via params. We then redirect the user using the posts_path route helper[12].\n\n\nPATCH\n\n\nPATCH requests are used to make minimal updates on resources.\n\nIf we are not replacing the whole resource (PUT) then this is the request to make.\n\nThis request is also defined in our update action such as in our PUT request.\n\n\nThe difference between PUT and PATCH\n\n\nPUT and PATCH request are quite different. This may be confusing. PATCH requests are used to make partial changes only. If we are updating a single post in the case of our example then a PATCH request makes more sense. However, if we are replacing all posts then a PUT request is the call to make.\n\nBased on documentation it seems both exist to reduce overhead. There is little work to be done if you are just replacing a single resource. For example, in the case a PATCH request is made comparing the update against the original (diff) and only applying the changes. Whereas, a PUT request updates the whole resource. It does not care about what has changed. It replaces everything.\n\nIn a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced. With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.[13]\n\nThere are also more HTTP methods such as HEAD, CONNECT and OPTIONS but I will not discuss them in this post. [14]\n\nThere are so many methods and resources to implement when building a modern web application using Rails. But familiarity with some RESTful APIs is one of the core fundamentals to consider. Of course not everything was covered in this post and I encourage you to read \"all the things\" for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. https://danielmiessler.com/study/url-uri/\n\n\nI also highly recommend this blog!\n\n\n\n\n2. rails generate scaffold will generate most of your application (models, views, controllers, etc). However, there are pieces that you may not need and their existence would pose performance/security issues for your application if they're dormant. It is recommended to only create or generate the pieces that you need unless you've a reason to actually use scaffold. https://qiita.com/Kolosek/items/697ad33bb82932ebed73/\n\n\n\n\n3. https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#generating-a-controller\n\n\n\n\n4. https://https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html\n\n\n\n\n\n5. https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\n\n\n\n\n6. https://flatironschool.com/blog/how-params-works-in-rails/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html\n\n\nAlso, see:\nhttps://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Helpers.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14188691/rails-tutorial-named-routes\n\n\n\n\n10.

knocking is cool. I personally believe it's among one of the best methods of securing a server. But what if you configured this for HTTP? This is an idea I've had for a while. Of course it's not really practical. But maybe if you had some sort of dead drop or needed to hide a webpage or other service, adding an additional layer of authentication might make sense.\\n\\n![jackknocking.gif](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/jackknocking.gif)\\n    *A GIF of Jack Torrance from The Shining knocking on a door*\\n\\nPort knocking works by (before a connection is even established) sending a *sequence* of ports[^1] which is a series of connection attempts (\\\"knocks\\\") to  closed ports on a remote host.\\n    \\n This allows the client/sender (wherever the sequence is being sent from) to open those ports on the remote host/receiver that is configured for port knocking. Thus, granting you access. It is the job of the server's firewall to open these ports but must be configured with a service such as *knockd* [^2] which watches firewall logs or interfaces for connection attempts. The service will then modify the firewall rules to open the ports allowing you to connect to the host. \\n\\n\\nWith this configuration you can keep services hidden until you are ready to access them. If you were to scan the remote host via Nmap the closed ports would not appear. Something we will take a look at later. One would have to check between each attempt to see if the port was actually opened. Some people would give up by that point. \\n\\n##iptables\\n\\nBefore we begin let's configure a basic firewall using iptables.\\n\\nAppend a rule to the INPUT (incoming connections) chain accepting all traffic on the loopback (localhost) interface:\\n\\n`iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT`\\n\\nTraffic that is generated and sent from the server to itself will be accepted.\\n\\nNow allow all established connections and traffic so we're not disconnected when we begin blocking connections:\\n\\n`iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT`\\n\\nSince we are port knocking HTTP we should create an iptables rule to allow access to SSH:\\n\\n`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`\\n\\nThis will accept connnections on the default SSH port of 22.\\n\\n**I highly recommend you configure SSH to not use the default port!**\\n\\nYou can also choose to ignore the basis of this post and port knock SSH instead.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow that we've added the rules for the connections we want to accept, let's drop everything else:\\n\\n`iptables -A INPUT -j DROP`\\n\\nYou can view the current iptables rules by running: `iptables -S`\\n\\nIt should be similar to this:\\n\\n`-P INPUT ACCEPT`\\n`-P FORWARD ACCEPT`\\n`-P OUTPUT ACCEPT`\\n`-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT`\\n`-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`\\n`-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`\\n`-A INPUT -j DROP`\\n\\nOnce this is done let's install the *iptables-persistent* package to ensure our rules are preserved on reboot:\\n\\n`apt-get install iptables-persistent`\\n\\nThen start the service:\\n\\n`service netfilter-persistent start`\\n\\n##knockd\\n\\nGreat, now that our intial firewall rules have been written, let's install and configure *knockd* which will be the port knocking service we will be using to facilitate the modification of the firewall rules and open connections to our specified ports. \\n\\n`apt-get install knockd`\\n\\nTo configure *knockd* we must edit the configuration file located at * /etc/knockd.conf* But before we make any changes let's take a look at what it has to offer.\\n\\nThe default configuration will look like:\\n\\n![Screenshot-from-2019-03-25-13-45-25.png](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-from-2019-03-25-13-45-25.png)\\n        *A screenshot of the default knockd configuration*\\n\\nThe first section, *[options]* contains the instruction to *UseSyslog* which allows *knockd* to log output to */var/log/messages* \\n\\nNext, we have the *[openSSH]* section which is where we will set the knocking sequence. \\n\\n*sequence    = 7000,8000,9000*\\n\\n**I recommend you change the default sequence!**\\n\\nBelow it we have a line for defining how long the sequence should be completed by before giving up. By default this is set for 5 seconds:\\n\\n*seq_timeout = 5*\\n\\n**Note that the timeout is defined in seconds only.** \\n\\n\\n\\nWe are then presented with a *command =*  definition which by default uses iptables:\\n\\n*command     = /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT*\\n\\nWhen the correct sequence is sent, this line defines what action to take which in this case will open up port 22.\\n\\nBecause of the append `-A` option in the rule, it will be added to the end of our IPTables configuration which if you view via `iptables -S` will be after the rule we created to drop all connections. \\n\\nThis will prevent us from accessing the host so we want to add a version of this before that last rule and not after. \\n\\nThe command should be modified to insert (`-I`) the rule at the top as follows:\\n\\n`command = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT 1 -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`\\n\\nFor our purposes we are port knocking HTTP so specify 80 as the port to open and not SSH port 22.\\n\\nThe next line, *tcpflags* sets the flag that must exist in the TCP packets in order to validate the connection.[^3]\\n\\nBy default it is set as *syn* and we will keep it as such.\\n\\n\\n\\nSYN is part of the TCP 3-way handshake.[^4] This is used to create a connection. \\n        \\n        ![ezgif-2-79fa08b06794.png](https://blog-odoom-net.fly.dev/content/images/2023/12/ezgif-2-79fa08b06794-1.png)\\n        *A diagram of the 3-way handshake*\\n        \\n        \\nTo negotiate and start a TCP connection, three messages are sent: SYN, SYN-ACK and ACK.

This allows for multiplexing which combines multiple data streams into a single physical connection via source and destination port numbers as mentioned.[5]\n\n\n\nActually configuring knockd\n\n\nThe last section [closeSSH] is similar to the first but uses a different sequence and removes the rule from iptables to close the connection.\n\n\nThis is annoying so we will confgiure the knockd service to do this automatically.\n\n\nTo make this possible we will edit the configuration file /etc/knockd.conf, removing everything and creating a new section called HTTP:\n\n\n[options]\n\nUseSyslog\n\n\n[HTTP]\n\nsequence = 6000,7000,8000,9000\n\ntcpflags = syn\n\nseq_timeout = 45\n\nstart_command = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT 1 -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\ncmd_timeout = 59\n\nstop_command = /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\n\nThe cmd_timeout option tells knockd to wait 59 seconds before executing our stop_command line which will remove our start_command iptables rule.\n\n\nYou can also add as many ports as you need but be sure that the connection attempt can be made in the amount of time (in seconds) specified via seq_timeout\n\n\nRemember to choose a unique sequence!\n\n\nNow that we have configured knockd, before we restart the service to apply the changes let's install Nginx Web server:\n\n\napt-get install nginx\n\n\nTo (optionally) start Nginx on boot you can also run the following:\n\nsystemctl enable nginx\n\n\nNow, restart the knockd service:\n\n\nservice knockd restart\n\n\n\nPort knocking\n\n\nIf you visit the FQDN or IP of your host you will be presented with nothing. That's because we haven't opened the HTTP port.\n\n\nThere are many ways to do this such as using the knock client which is available with the knockd package we installed previously. But we won't be using that.\n\n\nInstead, we will be using a for loop and the application Nmap:\n\n\nfor x in 6000 7000 8000 9000; do nmap -Pn --host_timeout 201 --max-retries 0 -p $x 178.128.156.225; done\n\n\nLet's take a look at the options passed to the nmap command:\n\n\n-Pn treats all hosts as active so prevents host discovery scanning which is inefficient for our purpose.[6]\n\n\n--host_timeout 201 stops trying to connect after 201 seconds.\n\n\n--max-retries is the number of times to retry the port scan. We don't want nmap to rescan so it is set to 0.\n\n\n-p is the port option which follows our sequence then the IP of the server who's HTTP port we want to open.\n\n\nYou should see a similar output to the following:\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of port knocking with nmap\n\n\nNow if you connect the FQDN or IP of your web server you should see the default Welcome to nginx! template page:\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of default Nginx template\n\n\nYou can now access the site but remember you only have 59 seconds until the connection closes as defined in our cmd_timeout option. Then the webpage will be inaccessible on reload.\n\n\nIf we were to use nmap to scan our host for ports, we would only see that our specified SSH port is open.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of nmap scan results\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nSo yes this is kind fo silly. But there are many examples for why someone would want this configuration. If you want to keep an application private by requiring an extra step this is a method to use. One could marry this with VPN and other tools to create a very secure infrastructure. There are so many creative options. What will you do?\n\n\nPostscript:\n\nThe host used in this post was created for this post only.

TCPFlags = fin|syn|rst|psh|ack|urg\n    \n    Only pay attention to packets that have this flag set. When using TCP flags, knockd will IGNORE tcp packets that don't match the flags. This is different than the normal behavior, where an incorrect packet would invalidate the entire knock, forcing the client to start over.

In this post I will discuss my opinion regarding this decision and how this ripple effect of online censorship doesn't solve anything.</font></dl>\\n\\n\\nTwo mass shootings in 24 hours. One of many which have plagued the United States. Yet, nothing seems to be done. The issue is with gun control. Not video-games (an overused scapegoat) and certainly not the Internet.[^1] In the case of the El Paso, Texas shooting there were multiple infleunces, such as white nationalism which has been on the rise since Trump took over the White House.\\n\\nIn a blog post on the Cloudflare Blog, CEO and Co-founder Matthew Prince posted that Cloudflare would be \\\"terminating service for 8Chan.\\\" [^2] I can only attribute this irrational decision due to sleep deprivation based on the time the post was published. But this is just a theory, nothing factual here. \\n\\n### It's a financial decision\\n\\nCloudlfare is a company. It has the freedom to operate (within the boundaries of the law) as it pleases. So it has every right to remove 8Chan as a customer. BUT.[^3] The reason for this termination has no moral justification. I'd like to believe that Cloudflare believes in a free and open Internet. But based on past behavior that is probably not the case.[^4] During the draft of this post I would later find out through a link on Hacker News that Cloudflare has filed for IPO. [^5] So this would make sense as to why  Cloudflare has blocked 8Chan from utilizing its services. \\n    \\nCloudflare isn't the only service provider to have done something this unreasonable. In August 2018, the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars was banned from services such as YouTube, Facebook and Spotify. [^6] And like Cloudflare these companies can do whatever they want.\\n\\nBut surely I cannot be the only one who sees this as an issue? This is the Internet. In America we cite the constitution regularly and reference the first Amendment and how we have \\\"freedom of speech.\\\" Yet, we know that freedom doesn't always mean free and it is quite limited. However, I truly believe the Internet is and should be a place where we get to challenge that. And not just people in certain nations but globally. \\n\\n### We have to give everyone a platform\\n\\nWe have to give everyone a platform. Whether we agree with them or not. As long as they aren't threatening the safety of others, they should be free to say what they want. This is why Liberals aren't as liberal as they think. Until their beliefs are challenged and they must actually question their liberty they're just posers.\\n\\nLiberty on paper should be the same online and in person. We're not meant to agree with everyone. It's okay to play \\\"devil's advocate\\\" or hear the opinions of others to challenge our own beliefs. One doesn't have to let the echo chamber feed them. \\n\\nPersonally, the Cloudflare decision is very dissapointing. Because I've used their services for years. This website runs on Cloudflare. \\n\\nDo you really believe that without 8Chan these mass shootings would not have taken place? These incidents were triggered by an idelogy promoted by the current President of the United States. When you refuse to denounce extremists you are not part of the problem. You are the problem.[^7]\\n\\n8Chan unfortuantely was a scapegoat for Cloudflare. A way to show potential investors that they \\\"play by the rules\\\" and aren't afraid to avoid controversy. As of this post 8Chan is unavailable on the clearnet. But I do not doubt that it or a clone will return. Because it's the Internet. Attempting to stifle free speech here is useless. When one site goes down, there is another to take its place just as quickly.\\n\\n### Cancel culture is toxic\\n\\nI think one of the biggest problems within our society is how coddled we've become. Groupthink is stronger than ever before and if you're not careful, sharing an unpopular opinion can ruin your career.[^8] This is why I barely Tweet my opinions. Because the implications can be dangerous. For this reason, I tend to RT and only tweet what I can get away with. However, even that's not enough and the only place I feel somewhat safe at the moment is on my blog.

No password manager is an even worse idea. But let me explain. Because I am contradicting myself when I say this.\n\n\nIn the time of Work From Home (WFH) basic security is essential.\n\nYou've probably told yourself you can remember your passwords or use one password for everything. However, this isn't true. You're only human. And even not knowing your password is an added security benefit. Generate and forget.\n\n\nThis is where password managers become useful. Before we begin this journey, I want to preface that if you're not using Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) you should immediately. And even if the only option you have is using a mobile phone, it's better than nothing. Sure, SIM Swap attacks are still common. They're rare but do happen ocassionally. Yet, some security is better than none.\n\n\nI'm also here to sell you something. I won't lie to you. I'm going to sell you the specific password manager I use and share some information regarding my setup.

It requires compliance, collaboration and the willingness to try new things. There is no one way of implementing DevOps across a team. From what I've read, lots of teams within various companies do it differently. However, though there are different practices, these teams exercise the same core principles which basically amount to multiple teams working together to support each other while testing and deploying rapidly.[^1]\\n\\n##Culture Clash\\nUnfortunately, one of the biggest issues when implementing DevOps (in my experience but most will agree) is the cultural shift. And that's what makes DevOps difficult. It's not the tools, it's the people. You can change tools, make them \\\"work\\\", that's the easy part. But you can't change people, you can only persuade them.  \\n\\nThe cause of this depends of course on the situation. It could be lack of knowledge from leadership who may be unwilling to follow this new path simply because they do not understand it. And for this reason they may feel threatened. Another reason could be not wanting to change. Because who wants or needs change? \\\"Things have been great the way they've been and we've never needed this as everything has been working fine.\\\" Which makes total sense because here in tech things move slowly and there is no such thing as advancement.[^2]\\n\\nAnd sure, you may take the time to deliver multiple presentations internally, educating your team or even your Technical Lead one-on-one to minimize conflict and social engineer the situation to sway them when asking for change. However, no matter how hard you try the result is imperfect. You're at a better place than in the beginning. But it's not where you need to be. Because your DevOps implementation is half-assed. Who re-painted the purple fence red on the front but left the back purple?   \\n\\nThen you're stuck. \\n\\nSo what do you do? Surely, you don't want a war. Your job isn't to be a soldier and you know you should stay out of politics. In this case, it's best to minimize conflict.

If leadership refuses to follow the principals or make lazy excuses regarding there not being enough time to practice the tenets of DevOps it's important to have a \"This will be fine\" attitude. Allow everything to play out because eventually things will come crashing down. Because DevOps practices aren't something you can cherry-pick and expect to work. You have to go all the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. I'll take this moment to clarify. Though this isn't a post about what DevOps is I don't want to mislead so I will explicitly state that the point of DevOps isn't to just push code but to improve flow. ↩︎\n    \n\n 2.
